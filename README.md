# Identity
Name : Andra Achmaddinata

# AI usage
I use chatgpt to ask "how I create a new project in qt creator", "how I get qt kits", and how to structure the project files that I have created on github.  

# Collaboration usage
I asked Faathir Arsa to install QT Creator on my laptop.

# Commit Rules
Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit.  If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
